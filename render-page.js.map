Visualizing large graphs, however, often results in excessive edges crossings and overlapping nodes. We propose a new scalable approach called FACETS that helps users adaptively explore large million-node graphs from a local perspective, guiding them to focus on nodes and neighborhoods that are most subjectively interesting to users. We contribute novel ideas to measure this interestingness in terms of how surprising a neighborhood is given the background distribution, as well as how well it matches what the user has chosen to explore. FACETS uses Jensen-Shannon divergence over information-theoretically optimized histograms to calculate the subjective user interest and surprise scores. Participants in a user study found FACETS easy to use, easy to learn, and exciting to use. Empirical runtime analyses demonstrated FACETS’s practical scalability on large real-world graphs with up to 5 million edges, returning results in fewer than 1.5 seconds.'\n                 paper_linky = '../data/17-sdm-facets-mage.pdf'\n                 paper_img = '../imgs/projs/pr-facets-cj.png'\n                 img_caption = ''\n                 video_linky = ''\n    />\n\n  </div>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/pr_facets.js","import React from 'react'\nimport Link from 'gatsby-link'\nimport Navigoat from '../layouts/navigoat.js'\n\nimport {Col, Row} from 'react-bootstrap'\n\n\nexport default class ProjectPage extends React.Component {\n\n  render() {\n    const {title, authors, paper_title, abstract, paper_linky, img_caption, paper_img, video_linky} = this.props;\n    var youtube_linky = null;\n\n    let video_link_el = null;\n    let video_frame = null;\n    if (video_linky != ''){\n      youtube_linky = video_linky.split('/')\n      youtube_linky = 'https://youtu.be/' + youtube_linky[youtube_linky.length-1]\n\n      video_link_el =   <a className=\"mat-link\" href={youtube_linky}>\n          Video\n          <span className=\"glyphicon glyphicon-facetime-video right-glyph\"></span>\n        </a>\n\n      video_frame =  <div>\n        <div className=\"proj-heading\" > Video</div>\n        <iframe className='fitted-frame'\n                src={video_linky}\n                frameBorder=\"0\"\n                allowFullScreen>\n        </iframe>\n        </div>\n    }\n\n\n    return (\n      <Row>\n        <Col md={3}></Col>\n        <Col md={6}>\n          <h2> {title} </h2>\n\n          <div className=\"proj-heading\"> Paper</div>\n          <span className=\"paper-title-text\">\n            {paper_title}\n          </span>\n          <br/>\n          <span className=\"author-text\">\n            {authors}\n          </span>\n\n          <div className=\"project-img-div\">\n            <img src={paper_img} alt=\"Crown Jewel Figure\" />\n            <div className=\"caption-text\"> {img_caption} </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"proj-heading\" > Abstract</div>\n          {abstract}\n\n          <div className=\"proj-heading\" > Materials</div>\n          <a className=\"mat-link\" href=\"../data/14-bigdata-mage.pdf\">\n            PDF\n            <span className=\"glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt right-glyph\"></span>\n          </a>\n          <a className=\"mat-link\" href=\"../data/14-bigdata-mage.pdf\">\n            BibTex\n            <span className=\"glyphicon glyphicon-education right-glyph\"></span>\n          </a>\n          {video_link_el}\n\n          {video_frame}\n\n\n        </Col>\n        <Col md={3}></Col>\n      </Row>\n    );\n  }\n};\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/layouts/pr_page.js","import React from 'react'\nimport Link from 'gatsby-link'\nimport Navigoat from '../layouts/navigoat.js'\nimport ProjectPage from '../layouts/pr_page.js'\n\nexport default () =>\n  <div>\n    <Navigoat active_tab='projs'/>\n    <ProjectPage title = 'GraSP: Graph Streaming Partitioner'\n                 paper_title = 'GraSP: Distributed Streaming Graph Partitioning'\n                 authors = 'Casey Battaglino, Robert Pienta, and Richard Vuduc'\n                 abstract = 'This paper presents a distributed, streaming graph partitioner, Graph Streaming Partitioner (GraSP), which makes partition decisions as each vertex is read from memory, simulating an online algorithm that must process nodes as they arrive.

Visualizing graph query results is challenging, requiring effective summarization of a large number of subgraphs, each having potentially shared node-values, rich node features, and flexible structure across queries. We present VIGOR, a novel interactive visual analytics system, for exploring and making sense of query results. VIGOR uses multiple coordinated views, leveraging different data representations and organizations to streamline analysts sensemaking process. VIGOR contributes: (1) an exemplar-based interaction technique, where an analyst starts with a specific result and relaxes constraints to find other similar results or starts with only the structure (i.e., without node value constraints), and adds constraints to narrow in on specific results; and (2) a novel feature-aware subgraph result summarization. Through a collaboration with Symantec, we demonstrate how VIGOR helps tackle real-world problems through the discovery of security blindspots in a cybersecurity dataset with over 11,000 incidents. We also evaluate VIGOR with a within-subjects study, demonstrating VIGOR’s ease of use over a leading graph database management system, and its ability to help analysts understand their results at higher speed and make fewer errors.'\n                 paper_linky = '../data/17-vast-vigor.pdf'\n                 paper_img = '../imgs/projs/pr-vigor-cj.png'\n                 img_caption = 'A screenshot of VIGOR showing an analyst exploring a DBLP co-authorship network, looking for researchers who have co-authored papers at the VAST and KDD conferences.

The matches’ layouts (general shape) mirror that of the original query.'\n                 video_linky = 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2L7Y5mCh1s?rel=0'\n    />\n\n  </div>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/pr_visage.js","import React from 'react'\nimport Link from 'gatsby-link'\nimport Navigoat from '../layouts/navigoat.js'\n\nexport default () =>\n  <div>\n    <Navigoat active_tab='projs'/>\n    <div className = \"container\" id=\"top-padded\">\n      <div className=\"row\" id=\"art_food_selector\">\n\n        <div className=\"col-sm-3\">\n          <div className=\"panel panel-default\">\n            <div className=\"panel-heading\">\n              <h3 className=\"panel-title\">VISAGE</h3>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"panel-body\">\n              <Link to=\"/pr_visage/\"><img className=\"fit-img\" src=\"../imgs/projs/visage.png\" alt=\"VISAGE\"/></Link>\n              <p>Visual, interactive query construction without coding!</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"col-sm-3\">\n          <div className=\"panel panel-default\">\n            <div className=\"panel-heading\">\n              <h3 className=\"panel-title\">VIGOR</h3>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"panel-body\">\n              <Link to=\"/pr_vigor/\"><img className=\"fit-img\"  src=\"../imgs/projs/vigor.png\" alt=\"VIGOR\"/></Link>\n              <p>Quickly visualize thousands of subgraph results!</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"col-sm-3\">\n          <div className=\"panel panel-default\">\n            <div className=\"panel-heading\">\n              <h3 className=\"panel-title\">MAGE</h3>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"panel-body\">\n              <Link to=\"/pr_mage/\"><img className=\"fit-img\"  src=\"../imgs/projs/mage.png\" alt=\"MAGE\"/></Link>\n              <p>Find </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"row\" id=\"art_food_selector\">\n\n        <div className=\"col-sm-3\">\n          <div className=\"panel panel-default\">\n            <div className=\"panel-heading\">\n              <h3 className=\"panel-title\">FACETS </h3>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"panel-body\">\n              <Link to=\"/pr_facets/\">\n              <img className=\"fit-img\"  src=\"../imgs/projs/facets.png\" alt=\"facets\"/>\n              </Link>\n              <p>Locally explore massive graphs faster than ever.</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"col-sm-3\">\n          <div className=\"panel panel-default\">\n            <div className=\"panel-heading\">\n              <h3 className=\"panel-title\">GraSP</h3>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"panel-body\">\n              <Link to=\"/pr_grasp/\">\n              <img className=\"fit-img\"  src=\"../imgs/projs/grasp.png\" alt=\"GraSP\"/>\n              </Link>\n              <p>Fast streaming graph partitioning.
